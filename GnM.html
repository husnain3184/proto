		<h2>The Challenge</h2>
		<hr>
		<p>
			ROB website redesign was my graduate studies’ milestone project. In a team of three,  I assumed the roles of UX designer and Project Manager.<br>
			The project’s key objective was to determine how to increase readership, site engagement, usability and an experience that is similar to its other platforms.
		</p>
		<p class="no-padding ">
			From the gathered business requirements we set our project goals to be:
			<ol class="pebble-watch">
				<li>Create a new user experience for the ROB Magazine for the mobile platform.
				</li>
				<li>Format mobile layouts that speak to the bespoke character of the ROB.
				</li>
				<li>Design to increase reader engagement and loyalty, hence increasing the number of readers on the main ROB Magazine landing page.
				</li>
				<li>Develop features, constraints and requirements for the new concept.
				</li>
			</ol>
		</p>

		<h2>Research</h2>
		<hr>
		<p>The team analyzed ROB magazine’s current website and of its competitors who provided similr services:
		 </p>
		 <p>
		 	Competitor Analysis: Listing top 10 Globe and Mail competitors we, drew up a comparison chart and studied trends and ways of presenting information. From information architecture to features used for attracting readers and subcribers to analyzing the usability constraints, we detailed everything and presented to our clients. 
		 </p>
		 <p>
		 	Internal Analysis: We conducted a usability test with some of our colleagues to identify the pain points of current ROB magazine site and to learn wabout site bounce rate and time spent by readers on a particular page and story. In tandem, we carried out a SWOT (Strength, Weakness, Opportunity & Threat) analysis which made it easy for us to rethink and design for the experience.

		<h2>Structuring</h2>
		<hr>
		<h3>Storyboarding</h3>
		<p>This phase began with the team sorting out all the features that could be improved or improvised in the mobile site to achieve our objectives. We started off by sorting and prioritizing the low hanging fruits and others that needed some detailed work.<br> 
		Below are some whiteboard sketches and a 2 iteration journey from wireframes to high fidelity.</p>

		<h2>Wireframes & Mockups</h2>
		<hr>
		<p>This section highlights different features that the team focuse on.</p>
		<p> 1. Landing Page:<br> 
			The magazine’s landing page was redesigned considering the following aspects; page hierarchy, using direct images, proper categorization, increase traffic 	through landing page, clarity in graphics and subscripton tags.
		</p>
		<div class="landing-page-img">

		<p> 2. Subscription:<br> 
			Redesigning addressed issues like; a forced paywall and payment for subscription which turned away many readers who wanted to see the value of the magazine before investing into it. Also, having a lot of text and call to action buttons made it further frustrating and created an inconsistent experience within the magazine.

		<p> 3. Article Pages: <br> 
			With article pages, our aim was to create a unique layout that leverages the bespoke features of the print and to boost engagement by giving readers some control, use of more interactive visuals, reduce or smartly cover ads and include proper headlines and summaries which would cut down continuous text flow. Below are the few examples of what we came up with.

			<img src="assets/Globe/Article-3.png">
			<img src="assets/Globe/article-2.png">
		</div>
		
		<p> 4. Article Recirculation: <br> 
			Recirculation means, how often the readers click on other artciles from one article. This determines user engagement and hence time spent on with the site which, was significantly low. The only way to go to another article was to go back to categories on homepage or, search.<br> 
			We decided to add an article slider on the page which would give an easy access and use images and key words to attract readers to that article. We tested our designs and made adjustments as we progressed, below are some wireframes and images from our iterations.
