            <p>Pebble Time Smart Watch was a Kickstarter project, developed by Pebble Technology and released on 14th May 2015. It was one of the early competitors of Apple and Android smart watches and claimed to have certain features and usability, hence, a group of four designers (myself included) took up the task to evaluate the product for its function and user-friendliness.</p>

            <h2>Overview</h2>
            <p class="padding">The Pebble Time offers the basic smartwatch features of its time. The version that we evaluated had added features like timeline, mobile platform compatibility, extended battery life and apps. support. We planned to evaluate the product on design quality, its features and usability from perspectives of non-smartwach users and primary consumers. I played my role in learning and planning for the research methods to be used for evaluation. The two methods used were; Task Analysis and Heuristic Evaluation. The outcome of this project was a detailed report on the test findings, analysis and recommendations.
            </p>
            <h2>Method 1: Task Analysis</h2>
            <p class="padding">Task Analysis is a usability assessment technique where a user is given a set of tasks and asked to complete those using the system being tested.
            </p>
            <p>
            <span>STEP 1 - Define Scope/ Problem:</span> 
            Our high-level scope was to test the basic functions and features of Pebble Time and observe each participant’s experience through the process. Our detailed scope covered four measurable categories; Customization & Settings, Messaging Feature, Calling Feature and Applications' Experience.
            </p>
            <div class="step-2 flex">
                <div class="item-1">
            <p class="padding">
                <span>STEP 2 - Design Task List:</span> 
                The scoped categories were broken down into sub-tasks, each of which required the users to perform the activity in a given time. A few dummy tasks were added to see how the users reacted andd if they felt importance of that functionality in Pebble Time.

                <span>STEP 3 - Test & Observe:</span> 
                The test was carried out with Pebble Time connected to the Android device. We used video cameras to record each participant’s experessions, interactions and comments. I collected data logs, observed and took notes of the findings and reactions.

            </div>
            <p class="padding">At completion of the test, the participants were asked to rate the overall experience of using the smartwatch through a 5-point scale for six subjective measures. Using all our collected feedback the team came up with a list of recommendations and description for each.

            <p>The goal of this method was to test Pebble watch against iOS and Android. It was tested by five users, working through a list of design goals to focused on different properties of the product. The users rated for each criteria and provided feedback, checking the pragmatism and compatibility.
            </p>
            <p>STEP 1 - Define the Scope: To evaluate the product against a checklist based on selected UX heuristics, for both iOS and Android platforms.
            </p>
            <p>
                STEP 2 - Prepare the Checklist: Categories covered; Functionality and Features, Navigability, Aesthetics, Accessibility and Consistency, Hardware Aesthetics

            </p>
            <p>STEP 3 - Test & Observe: Users evaluated and gave scores and comments for both platforms. Findings were documented and analyzed for recommendations.</p>
