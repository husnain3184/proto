                ShopEase is a grocery shopping application that displays grocery items, their costs, currency conversions and store comparisons.
                <br> This project was taken up as part of a course and was carried out by a team of five. The objective was to design a solution that assists international students and immigrants in resolving initial cultural and social barriers by helping them understand the value of Canadian dollar in comparison to their home country’s currency.

                        Exploratory research was the way to approach the recent immigrants to Canada, particularly international students and Ontario was our starting point. It included conducting online surveys and a secondary research. 
                        <br> The survey questions were more focused on the international student’s grocery shopping journey, getting insights about their thinking, doing and feeling patterns. We were able to get over 50 volunteers of which, over 60% were between the age of 26 and 35.

                    Based on our research results the team brainstormed on features that should be made part of the app. The app has a broad breadth of features and is broken down into four main tools displayed on the bottom navigation; Browse (homepage) to browse through a list of categories or search for the product, Scan to scan the barcode of the item and display product details, Converter to help with money conversions, My Shopping List for storing all the items added to the cart and a “Wish List” section for items that users want but may not find in any local grocery store that is on the platform, this information is useful for grocery stores to identify consumer wants.
