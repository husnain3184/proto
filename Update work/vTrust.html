                vTrust is a web application that measures, levels of engagement and trust between a financial advisor and their client.
                <br> The project was a proof of concept, designed for Veriday. A team of five individuals enrolled in MDEI program, worked on it for 4 months, under the mentoship of a Senior UX Consultant/ Professor at University of Waterloo and VP of Product from Veriday.
                <br> My role on this project was of a designer, contributing in all phases, but heavily in analysis and structuring.

                        Competitve Analysis and Surveys, were two methods undertaken for research. The first one was for us to have a clear vision of the financial industry; their requirements, practices and pain points.
                        <br> Each of us took on at-least two institutions and highlighted their mission and features. This gave us a high-level overview of where the industry stands today, who the regulators and trendsetters are, and details about the workforce.

            </div>
            <p>

                Surveys on the other hand, gave us detailed insights and understanding of the relation between the two stakeholders; financial advisors and the clients. The team designed two questionnaires for participants: one to better understand the industry and how financial advisors build relationships with their clientele; and the second to collect data about client experiences with their financial advisors. In total, four advisors and a client were surveyed.

                    <br> I, lead the whiteboarding activity where we highlighted need, journey, behavior, pain points and solutions. We also drew up an experience map to evaluate our concepts in terms of emotional design, human behaviour, motivation & engagement and mental models.
