				<h2>The Challenge</h2>

		<p>
			Pebble Time is one of the early competitors of Apple and Android smart watches, it was introduced in the market as a cheaper but a better alternative to other smart watches, also, in comparison to its predecessors, it had better functionality, features and usability.

The intended result for this analysis was a detailed report on our research methods, findings and recommendations for any improvements.
