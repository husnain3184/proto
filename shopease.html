               		A grocery shopping app. that, displays cost of grocery items, converts the value between currencies and compares the price between Canadian grocery stores.  
The objective of this application was, to create a solution that would assist international students and immigrants in resolving some cultural and social barriers by helping them understand the value of Canadian dollar in comparison to their home country’s currency.

		<h2>The Initial Dive</h2>
		<hr>
		<p>
			The team aimed to help recent student immigrants assimilate into the Canadian culture and lifestyle, optimize their spending and shopping experience, plus, educate them to make smart purchase decisions.

		</p>
		<br>
		<br>
		<p>
		For our exploratory research we reached out to the recent immigrants to Canada, particularly international students and limited our demographics to Ontario. The research included conducting online surveys and a secondary research. 
The survey included questions focused on the international student’s grocery shopping journey, to get to know more about what they think, do and feel about their choices. We were able to get over 50 volunteers of which, over 60% were between the age of 26 and 35. 
		</p>
		<br>
		<p>
			Following are some stats from the research:

			</div>
		<p>
	The survey also asked participants to list any grocery shopping apps they use. We used that list to study what already exists and searched any other grocery apps in the market. We could not find an app that offer a similar service. It was clear that we were designing a new solution. 
Additionally, we conducted research on the cost of living and transportation for international students in Ontario. On average, a single student spends approximately $500 per month on grocery ("Study And Living Costs") and about 100$ on public transportation ("What It Will Cost").

		<p>Based on our research results the team brainstormed on features that should be made part of the app. The app has a broad breadth of features and is broken down into four main tools displayed on the bottom navigation; Browse (homepage) to browse through a list of categories or search for the product, Scan to scan the barcode of the item and display product details, Converter to help with money conversions, My Shopping List for storing all the items added to the cart and a “Wish List” section for items that users want but may not find in any local grocery store that is on the platform, this information is useful for grocery stores to identify consumer wants.</p>
