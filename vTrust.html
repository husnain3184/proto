		<h2>The Initial Dive</h2>
		<hr>
		<p>
			The devil always lies in the details, hence, getting our initial research and analysis as detailed as possible was the first step in our process.
		</p>
		<br>
		<br>
		<p>
			<i>Competitve Analysis</i> - The first essential step was to have a clear vision of our end users’ industry; their requirements, practices and pain points before embarking on the product development cycle.<br> 
		    The team conducted a competitive analysis of known financial institutions. This gave us a high-level overview of where the industry stands today, who the regulators and trendsetters are, and details about the workforce.
		</p>
		<br>
		<p>
			<i>Interviews and Surveys</i> - This technique have us detailed insights and understanding of the relation between our two major stakeholders; financial advisors and the clients.<br> 
			Various professional financial advisors were interviewed and surveyed, along with people who consulted or were looking to consult an advisor.<br>
		    The team designed two separate questionnaires for participants: one to better understand the industry and how financial advisors build relationships with their clientele; and the second to collect data about client experiences with their financial advisors. In total, four advisors and one client was digitally interviewed.

		<h2>Structuring</h2>
		<hr>
		<p>Before starting any design, we spent considerable time in building sense of the workflows and end user journeys. Main use cases in consideration were ‘ An advisor logging-in through vTrust’ and ‘An advisor logging-in using a digital agent (assuming the compatibility)’. We drew an experience map to judge our concept in terms of emotional design, human behaviour, motivation & engagement and mental models. </p>
